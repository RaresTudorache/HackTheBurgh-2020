# Description

Worked in a five person team to develop a bot for the charity "Health in Mind", designed to help people that land on their website to find information more easily. We used
Dialogflow, incorporating Googles machine learning and allowing our bot to have actual
conversations with the client, instead of being just a decision tree algorithm.

* __Technology/Tools__: Dialogflow, Bootstrap, JavaScript
